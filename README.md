# ML Algorithms from Scratch
This repository contains implementations of some machine learning algorithms in Python. The implementations are based on the book *Machine Learning* by Zhihua Zhou.

The algorithms are implemented from scratch **without** using any machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn (except for SVMLIB) because the purpose of this repository is to understand the algorithms better rather than to use them.

Each algorithm is well **visualized** on the Watermelon Dataset from the book.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- LIBSVM (for SVM)

Note: Scikit-learn is not used in this repository.

## Algorithms
- [LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)](./LDA/)
- [Decision Tree](./decision_tree/)
- [SVM (Support Vector Machine)](./SVM/)
- [Na√Øve Bayes](./naive_bayes/)
- [K-Means and K-Means++](./k-means/)
